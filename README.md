BB.Common.WinForms
====================

Repository for holding the BB.Common.WinForms library - a small Metro-like control bundle. 

Note: this library was written pre-Metro days during moonlight hours, and was initially intended to be used in another project.

I make no guarantees regarding the quality and usefulness of this library!

# How To Use
